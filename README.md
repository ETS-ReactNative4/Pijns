This is a social networking application for the church. The heart of the application is to be able to lift up a prayer request, and then for people to let you know that they are praying for you. When someone shares a post, click on the pijn ('pigeon'), and your pijn will drop off a note. This note just says, "Hey, you're in my prayers." And whereas other apps let you 'like' a only once, on Pijns you can come back to a post and send a pijn note once a day.

This beta version displays mainly this core functionality. You can write posts, leave comments, and chat directly with friends. Currently, your posts will only be shared with people you are friends with. A current limitation also is that the only way to open an account is through Facebook.

In development:

Future developments:
1) Hashtags and tagging
2) other sign in methods
3) Different types of sharing: public (for anyone), friends (only friends), select (only selected friends), private (only you).
4) chat Notifications
5) push notifications
6) improve tutorial slides

Bugs:
1) On initial install, buttons do not function as intended
  (unlimited pijns, does not go to comments, does not got to chat, cannot pin)
